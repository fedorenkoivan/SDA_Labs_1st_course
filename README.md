# Algorithms and Data Structures - Labs

This repository contains my solutions for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course, written in **C** and **Python**. The labs cover a variety of topics, including data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and linked lists, as well as recursive algorithms and memory management.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course, which includes tasks like implementing data structures such as **linked lists**, **queues**, **stacks**, and applying **recursion** to solve problems. 

### Labs Overview
Some of the key tasks include:
- Creating linked lists and performing various operations on them (e.g., insertion, deletion, traversal).
- Implementing recursive algorithms such as computing the square root using a Taylor series and working with lists.
- Modifying and reorganizing data structures inside lists (reordering elements, sorting, etc.).

## Labs

### Lab 1: Linked Lists and Recursion (C)
- **Objective**: Create a linked list with **n** elements (n is a multiple of 20) and implement various operations such as insertion, deletion, and reordering elements within each group of 20.
- **Data Structure**: Singly linked list.
- **Task**: Reorder the list inside every set of 20 elements following a pattern:
