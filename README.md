# SDA Labs - 1st Course

This repository contains my practical work and assignments for the Structures and Data Algorithms course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into labs and includes implementations in Python and C.

## Topics Covered

- Basic algorithms and their implementations
- Data structures and their operations
- Algorithm complexity and efficiency analysis
- Sorting and searching techniques
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming

## Running the Code

### Python Requirements

To run the Python implementations:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fedorenkoivan/SDA_Labs_1st_course.git
cd SDA_Labs_1st_course

# Run a specific Python file
python3 path/to/file.py
```

### C Requirements

To compile and run C implementations:

```bash
# Compile a C file
gcc path/to/file.c -o output_name

# Run the compiled program
./output_name
```
